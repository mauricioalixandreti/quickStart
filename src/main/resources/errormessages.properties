#  Purpose: 	This file contains all front-end validation error messages used 	#
#				in the 	application.												#		
#	     		This file is similar to sitetext.properties file but instead 		#
#				of containing the message that are displayed throughout the 		#
#				site, it contains all the error messages.						    #
#	     														      				#
#  Location: 	This file should be placed in the classpath.						#	
#																					#
#  Related Configuration Files: action-servlet.xml						      		#	
#  													      							#	
#  Note: In the event that the site needs to display messages in different 			#
#  languages, the user should create another file and demarcate it as error 		#
#  messages for a specific language for example by naming it as 					#
#  errormessages_fr.properties for the French language				  				#	


# Define all key value pairs for error messages used in application here.
