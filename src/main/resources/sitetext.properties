#  Framework: 	Localization Framework					     				      	#
#  Purpose: 	This file acts as a message resource bundle and contains the text 	#
#				that is displayed on the site for the purposes of localization.		#		
#	     		Messages should be removed from the application and added to 		#
#				this file using key value pairs.							 		#
#	     														      				#
#  Location: 	This file should be placed in the classpath.						#	
#																					#
#  Related Configuration Files: action-servlet.xml						      		#	
#  													      							#	
#  Note: In the event that the site needs to display messages in different 			#
#  languages, the user should create another file and demarcate it as site	 		#
#  text for a specific language for example by naming it as sitetext_fr.properties	#
#  for the French language.											  				#	

# Define all key value pairs for site text used in application here.
